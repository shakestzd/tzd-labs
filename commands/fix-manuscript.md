Scan a Quarto manuscript project for common rendering issues and fix them.

## Issues to Detect and Fix

### 1. Double Title
The most common rendering issue. Happens when both the YAML `title:` field AND a `#` heading or bold title exist in the body.

**Detection:** Read the master `.qmd` file. Check if YAML frontmatter has a `title:` field AND the title page section also has a `#` heading with the same or similar text.

**Fix:** Remove the `#` heading from the body and keep only the YAML `title:` field. Or if the title page has formatted author info below it, keep the body version and remove `title:` from YAML. Ask the user which approach they prefer if unclear.

### 2. Wrong or Missing Template
**Detection:** Check the YAML `reference-doc:` path. Verify the file exists at that path relative to the .qmd file.

**Fix:** If the template file doesn't exist, offer to copy the correct one using `/set-journal`. If the path is wrong, correct it.

### 3. Stale Cross-References
**Detection:** Search all .qmd section files for Quarto cross-refs (`@tbl-`, `@fig-`) and verify each label is defined somewhere in the project. Also search for unresolved refs that rendered as `?@tbl-` or `?@fig-` in any .docx output.

**Fix:** List undefined references and suggest either defining the label or replacing with plain text (e.g., "Table 1").

### 4. Figure/Table Numbering Order
**Detection:** Trace the order of first reference to each table and figure through the manuscript sections (Introduction -> Methods -> Results -> Discussion). Compare with the assigned numbers.

**Fix:** If numbering doesn't match first-citation order, report the correct mapping and offer to update the cross-reference map or plain-text references.

### 5. Duplicate Title in Included Sections
**Detection:** When using `{{< include >}}` directives, check if multiple included files have `#` level headings that would create duplicate top-level structure.

**Fix:** Ensure only the main manuscript sections (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion) use `#` headings. Title page content should use bold text, not headings.

### 6. Inconsistent Terminology
**Detection:** Scan all section files for mixed usage of terms that should be consistent (e.g., "gold standard" vs "reference standard", mixed British/American spelling).

**Fix:** Report inconsistencies with line numbers and offer to normalize to the dominant usage.

### 7. Word Count Verification
**Detection:** Count words in the body text sections (Introduction through Conclusions), excluding markup, comments, and citations. Compare with the count stated on the title page.

**Fix:** Update the title page word count if it doesn't match. Also check abstract word count.

## Execution Protocol

1. **Find manuscript files.** If a specific file was given, use it. Otherwise, search for `.qmd` files with `format:` in YAML or `{{< include` directives.
2. **Run all 7 checks** on the identified files. Read each section file.
3. **Report findings** in a structured table with Issue, File, Line, and Status columns.
4. **Apply automatic fixes** for issues that have a clear correct resolution (double titles, stale refs, word count). For issues requiring a choice, present options and ask.
5. **Suggest next steps:** After fixing, recommend running `/build-manuscript` to regenerate the output, and `/fix-ai-tells` to scan for AI writing markers.
